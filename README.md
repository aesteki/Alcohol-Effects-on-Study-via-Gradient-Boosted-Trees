# Alcohol-Effects-on-Study-via-Gradient-Boosted-Trees
Improved accuracy (lower mean square error between predicted and actual target points) of previous works that predict student achievement with respect to students' demographics/social life by incorporating the Gradient Boosting (GB) technique in Decision Tree (DT) models.
The aim of the project was to improve the accuracy of student achievement prediction based on students' demographics and social life. The previous works in this field used decision tree (DT) models for this purpose, however, their accuracy was limited. To overcome this limitation, the project incorporated the gradient boosting (GB) technique in the DT models.

Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak decision tree models. It works by training subsequent models to correct the errors made by previous models. In this way, GB creates a strong model by combining the strengths of multiple weak models.

The project used the GB technique to improve the accuracy of the DT models in predicting student achievement. The mean square error (MSE) between the predicted and actual target points was used as the measure of accuracy. By incorporating the GB technique, the project was able to reduce the MSE, resulting in improved accuracy of the student achievement prediction models.

In conclusion, the project demonstrated that the incorporation of the GB technique in DT models is an effective method for improving the accuracy of student achievement prediction based on students' demographics and social life. The results of this project can be used by educational institutions and policy makers to better understand and support student achievement, and make informed decisions for students' future success.
